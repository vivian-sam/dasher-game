# dasher-game
Simple dasher 2D game that was created from a tutorial off of gamedev.tv while learning how to use cpp in game development
I do not own the sprite sheets used here. These were referenced off of the course: "C++ Fundamentals: Game Programming For Beginners" and are used for learning purposes.

I added my own code on top of the tutorial by adding functions to allow users to play again when they win or when they lose (provided that they press Y to indicate they wish to continue). New functions were also added to make the code more legible and efficient.

NOTE:
For testing of the solution, raylib is required.
A download of the raylib library is found here:
